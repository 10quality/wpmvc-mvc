Forked version for WPMVC.

**Lightweight MVC** is a small framework that adds *Models*, *Views* and *Controllers* to your custom **Wordpress** plugin or theme.

Lightweight MVC utilices existing Wordpress functionality preventing from overloading the already heavy loaded Wordpress core.

This framework was inspired by **Laravel** to add the MVC design pattern to Wordpress development in an efficient, elegant and optimized way.

## Coding Guidelines

The coding is a mix between PSR-2 and Wordpress PHP guidelines.
